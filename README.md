# MihailaViewTool

Various view specific methods for applications I use.

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'mihaila_view_tool'
```

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install mihaila_view_tool

## Usage

```ruby
DevcampViewTool::Renderer.copyright 'Mihaila Adrian', 'All rights reserved'
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
